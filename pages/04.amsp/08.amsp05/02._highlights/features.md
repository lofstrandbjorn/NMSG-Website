## CAX Handbook

AMSP-05 is a handbook that provides a generic process that enables operational planners to communicate their CAX requirements. It provides guidelines and best practices on what to consider during CAX planning & development and what interaction and information requirements are required to achieve success.

The Handbook complements and augments the Bi-SC 75-3 Collective Training and Exercise Directive (CT&ED) and is designed to provide support in planning, preparing and executing a (possibly distributed) CAX.
