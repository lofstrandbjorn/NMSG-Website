HLA is an open international standard, developed by the [Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO)](https://sisostds.org) and published by IEEE. The standards defines the components of HLA and what interfaces and properties they have.

HLA is a service-oriented architecture with a distributed enterprise service bus (HLA Runtime Infrastructure - RTI) that provides M&S services to participating systems (federates). Separate agreements (Federation Agreements) define how to use the more general HLA services and a detailed model (Federation Object Model - FOM) describe what type of information is exchanged in the distributed simulation (Federation).

[STANREC 4800 AMSP-04 NATO Education and Training Network Federation Architecture and FOM Design (NETN FAFD)](../../amsp04) is a NATO recommended reference Federation Agreement.
