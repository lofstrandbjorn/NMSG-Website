** NETN ETR WILL REPLACE LBML PENDING APPROVAL BY NMSG MS3 **

The **Low-Level Battle Management Language (LBML)**  is a part of the NETN SimC2 component and represent lower-level tasks suitable for providing simulation instructions to federates modelling individual units or platforms. 

LBML provides a simulator independent way of command and control over simulated entities both from a simulator operator perspective and when modelling command and control interaction between federates in a distributed simulation. LBML contains common low level tasks and commands that can easily be interpreted and executed by simulations that model the behavior of entities. It also defines a set of reports used by simulations to provide status updates of the tasks being executed.
