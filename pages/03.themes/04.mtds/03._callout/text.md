The MTDS Technical Reference Architecture provides a blueprint for the design of specific MTDS simulation environments for air, land and maritime and joint operations. 
Focus is on the technical agreements & requirements for a synthetic collective training environment for MTDS including:

* Networks
* Cross-Domain Security
* Common Simulation Services
* Simulation Environment Agreements

Existing NATO standards and services for distributed systems are the basis for all MTDS solutions including:

* CFBL-net Networking Services
* Federated Mission Networking (FMN) Standards and Services
* NATO Education and Training Network standards for Distributed Federated Simulation (STANAG 4603 and STANREC 4800 NETN)
* C2-Simulation Interoperability Standards
* NATO MSaaS provided common services and components
* Services for adaptation of national systems using legacy or non-NATO standards for interoperability.
