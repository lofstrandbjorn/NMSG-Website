## Vision & Goals
The MSaaS vision is that M&S products, data and processes are conveniently accessible and available on-demand to all users in order to enhance operational effectiveness. 

The goals of MSaaS are (1) to enable credible and effective M&S services, (2) to make M&S services available on-demand to a large number of users, (3) to make M&S Services available in an efficient and cost-effective way and (4) to provide the required level of agility to enable convenient and rapid integration of capabilities.

Establishing an Allied Framework for Modelling and Simulation as a Service requires effective operating procedures, processes, and standards for managing the lifecycle of services, service acquisitions, service components and registries, service providers, and service consumers. MSaaS is defined by the MSaaS Operational Concept Document, the MSaaS Technical Reference Architecture and Standard Operating Procedures.
