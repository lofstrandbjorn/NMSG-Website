## Verification and Certification of Compliance

Integration of distributed simulations and tools into interoperable federations of systems is a complex and time-consuming task, requiring extensive testing of individual components, interfaces, and an integrated solution. To support this task, NATO M&S relies on a Common Technical Framework based on standards like the [High Level Architecture (HLA)](../../../amsp/hla) standard.

The NATO Modelling and Simulation Group (NMSG) have established a Simulation Interoperability Test and Certification Service composed of processes, tools and organizations that manage and deliver services for testing, verification, and certification of simulation components to enable efficient integration.
