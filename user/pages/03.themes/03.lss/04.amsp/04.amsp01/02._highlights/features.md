# Standards

Open and common standards are essential enablers for simulation interoperability and re-use. This includes technical architecture standards, data interchange standards and best practices.

Not all existing M&S standards of interest to NATO and partners are covered by NATO STANAGs or STANRECs. A Standards Profile of both existing and emerging standards provides the community a more comprehensive overview of the state of M&S standards in NATO.

The NATO Modelling and Simulation Standards Profile (NMSSP) serve as an authoritative reference for NATO and nations on Modelling and Simulation (M&S) standardization products and their applications. The NMSSP provides guidance on selection and use of standards to promote interoperability, best practice and reuse in the M&S domain. The NMSSP is intended to address and support in particular, the establishment of a common technical framework to foster interoperability and reuse as defined in the <a href="../home/nmsmp">NATO M&S Master Plan</a>.

The NMSSP complements and is correlated with <a href="https://nhqc3s.hq.nato.int/Apps/Architecture/NISP/">NATO AdatP-34 NATO Interoperability Standards and Profiles (NISP)</a> and is maintained by the NMSG Modelling & Simulation Standards Subgroup (MS3).

Standards and products included in the Profile are not formally mandated by NATO, unless they are supported by a specific NATO Standardization Agreement (STANAG).
