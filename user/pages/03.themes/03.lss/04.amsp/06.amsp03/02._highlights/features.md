## CAX M&S

The AMSP-03 Guidance for M&S standards in NATO and Multinational Computer Assisted eXercises with Distributed Simulation is intended for the CAX manager to provide technical guidance on the development and use of distributed simulation and it also provides recommendations for the governance of interoperability standards for Training Centres.

The document covers the methodology of planning, execution and evaluation of multi-national CAX following a recommended set of standards for simulation interoperability, common data formats, and connectivity with other systems.
